Folder providing scripts to reproduce results and anlaysis of the MD Simulations part of the work:  A-to-I hyper-editing of dsRNA confers unique conformational dynamics and protein interactions


Input data to be download from Zenodo:
- 4 dump.xtc trjectories (1000 frames etc) for the 4 ensembles:
- all the bias energy files, needed to comoute weights -> Bias_and_ensembles_data.zip
- 2 full trajectories
